# 🚦 Accident Data Analysis – Task 04  
**SkillCraft Technology Virtual Internship**

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze a real-world accident dataset to identify patterns in:
- Road conditions
- Weather conditions
- Time of day
- Accident-prone locations (hotspots)

This task aims to extract actionable insights to understand contributing factors in traffic accidents.

---

## 📁 Dataset
**Source**: [US Accidents Dataset]  
**File Path**: `C:/Users/harik/OneDrive/Documents/us_accidents.csv`

Columns include:
- `Start_Time`
- `Weather_Condition`
- `Road_Condition`
- `City`
- (Other relevant attributes)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- ✅ Accident distribution by **hour of day**
- ✅ Accident trends across **weekdays**
- ✅ Top **road conditions** linked to accidents
- ✅ Top **weather conditions** involved
- ✅ City-wise **accident hotspots**

---

## 📊 Sample Visuals
- Bar plots for time-based trends
- Count plots for road and weather conditions
- Hotspot visual for top accident cities

---

## 📌 Insights Gained
- Most accidents occurred during **peak traffic hours**
- Poor weather (e.g., Rain, Fog) and **low visibility** conditions were common factors
- Specific **road conditions** showed higher accident frequency
- A few cities showed consistently high accident counts

---

## ✅ Outcome
- Gained practical experience in data preprocessing, cleaning, visualization, and extracting insights from real-world data.
- Learned how data can be used to support **public safety** and **urban planning**.
